## Implementation Priority

The system tries APIs in this order:

1. **Booking.com API** (Primary - global coverage, real-time data)
2. **CarTrawler API** (Secondary - comprehensive coverage)
3. **Rentalcars.com API** (Tertiary - large coverage)
4. **Amadeus Mock Data** (Fallback - realistic mock data)

## Environment Configuration

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Car Rental APIs
BOOKING_API_KEY=your_booking_api_key_here
BOOKING_AFFILIATE_ID=your_booking_affiliate_id_here
CARTRAWLER_API_KEY=your_cartrawler_api_key_here
RENTALCARS_API_KEY=your_rentalcars_api_key_here
```

## Testing

Run the debug script to test car rental APIs:

```bash
python debug_amadeus.py
```

Or test the full system:

```bash
python test_today.py
```

## API Response Format

The system expects car rental APIs to return data in this format:

```json
{
  "cars": [
    {
      "supplier": "Hertz",
      "vehicleType": "Economy Car",
      "pricePerDay": 45,
      "totalPrice": 315,
      "features": ["Automatic", "AC", "4 doors"]
    }
  ]
}
```
