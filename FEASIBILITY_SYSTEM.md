# Feasibility Checking and Backtracking System

## Overview
The feasibility checking system validates travel recommendations against real-world constraints including flight availability, hotel availability, and budget limitations. When destinations are not feasible, the system intelligently backtracks and suggests alternatives.

## Key Features

### 🔍 **Comprehensive Feasibility Validation**
- **Flight Availability**: Checks if flights are available from origin to destination
- **Hotel Availability**: Verifies suitable accommodations are available
- **Budget Validation**: Ensures total costs fit within specified budget
- **Traveler-Specific Constraints**: Considers traveler type (business, family, solo, etc.)

### 🔄 **Intelligent Backtracking**
- **Alternative Generation**: Automatically suggests nearby or similar destinations
- **Budget Adjustment Recommendations**: Provides specific budget increase suggestions
- **Constraint Analysis**: Identifies specific issues preventing feasibility
- **Fallback Options**: Multiple levels of alternative recommendations

### 📊 **Feasibility Scoring**
- **0.0 to 1.0 Scale**: Quantitative feasibility assessment
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Considers flights, hotels, budget, and constraints
- **Weighted Scoring**: Different weights for different constraint types
- **Threshold-Based Filtering**: Configurable minimum feasibility scores

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **FeasibilityChecker**
```python
class FeasibilityChecker:
    def check_destination_feasibility(destination, origin, travel_dates, budget, traveler_type)
    def check_multiple_destinations(destinations, origin, travel_dates, budget, traveler_type)
    def get_feasible_destinations(destinations, origin, travel_dates, budget, traveler_type, min_score)
    def suggest_budget_adjustments(destination, origin, travel_dates, current_budget, traveler_type)
```

#### 2. **FeasibilityResult**
```python
class FeasibilityResult:
    is_feasible: bool
    feasibility_score: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    issues: List[str]
    alternatives: List[str]
    estimated_total_cost: float
    flight_available: bool
    hotel_available: bool
    within_budget: bool
    details: Dict[str, Any]
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Destination Agent**
```python
def research_destination_with_feasibility(user_request, check_feasibility=True, min_feasibility_score=0.6)
```

## Feasibility Validation Process

### 1. **Flight Feasibility Check**
```python
def _check_flight_feasibility(origin, destination, departure_date, return_date):
    # Uses RealTravelAPIs to check actual flight availability
    # Returns: availability, cost, airline, duration, total flights
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- Flight availability from origin to destination
- Flight cost within allocated budget (40-60% of total budget)
- Preferred airlines and alliances (from preferences)
- Red-eye flight preferences
- Layover constraints

### 2. **Hotel Feasibility Check**
```python
def _check_hotel_feasibility(destination, departure_date, return_date, traveler_type):
    # Uses RealTravelAPIs to check hotel availability
    # Returns: availability, cost, hotel details, ratings
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- Hotel availability in destination
- Hotel cost within allocated budget (30-50% of total budget)
- Preferred hotel chains (from preferences)
- Traveler-type appropriate accommodations
- Required amenities availability

### 3. **Budget Validation**
```python
def _validate_total_budget(estimated_cost, budget_limit):
    # Validates total estimated cost against budget
    # Considers flight + hotel + estimated daily expenses
```

**Budget Allocation Logic:**
- **Business Travelers**: 60% flights, 40% hotels
- **Family Travelers**: 40% flights, 50% hotels
- **Leisure Travelers**: 50% flights, 35% hotels
- **Contingency Buffer**: 10% for unexpected expenses

## Backtracking and Alternative Generation

### 1. **Alternative Destination Generation**
```python
def _generate_alternatives(origin, destination, travel_dates, budget, traveler_type):
    # Generates nearby or similar destinations based on origin
    # Considers travel time, cost, and traveler preferences
```

**Alternative Logic:**
- **SFO Origin**: Monterey, Carmel, Napa Valley, Lake Tahoe, Santa Barbara, San Diego
- **NYC Origin**: Boston, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Montreal, Toronto, Miami
- **LAX Origin**: San Diego, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Phoenix, Seattle, Portland

### 2. **Budget Adjustment Suggestions**
```python
def suggest_budget_adjustments(destination, origin, travel_dates, current_budget, traveler_type):
    # Calculates required budget increase
    # Provides specific recommendations and alternatives
```

**Budget Adjustment Features:**
- Calculates exact increase needed
- Provides percentage increase
- Suggests new budget with 10% buffer
- Offers alternative destinations
- Considers traveler type for budget allocation

### 3. **Constraint Analysis**
```python
def _analyze_constraints(feasibility_result):
    # Identifies specific issues preventing feasibility
    # Provides actionable recommendations
```

**Common Constraint Issues:**
- No flights available
- Flight cost exceeds budget
- No suitable hotels
- Hotel cost exceeds budget
- Total cost exceeds budget
- Travel time constraints not met

## Integration with Travel Agent

### Enhanced Workflow
1. **Initial Research**: Standard destination research
2. **Feasibility Check**: Validate all recommended destinations
3. **Filter Results**: Keep only feasible destinations
4. **Generate Alternatives**: If no feasible destinations found
5. **Budget Analysis**: Provide adjustment suggestions
6. **Final Recommendations**: Return feasible options with analysis

### Usage Example
```python
# Initialize agent with feasibility checking
agent = DestinationResearchAgent()

# Research with feasibility validation
result = agent.research_destination_with_feasibility(
    user_request="I want a beach destination within 3 hours of SFO for $500",
    check_feasibility=True,
    min_feasibility_score=0.6
)

# Result includes:
# - Only feasible destinations
# - Feasibility analysis
# - Cost estimates
# - Alternative suggestions if needed
```

## Feasibility Scoring Algorithm

### Scoring Factors
- **Flight Availability**: 40% weight
- **Hotel Availability**: 30% weight
- **Budget Compliance**: 20% weight
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: 10% weight

### Score Calculation
```python
feasibility_score = 1.0

# Flight availability (40% weight)
if not flight_available:
    feasibility_score -= 0.4
elif flight_cost > flight_budget_limit:
    feasibility_score -= 0.3

# Hotel availability (30% weight)
if not hotel_available:
    feasibility_score -= 0.3
elif hotel_cost > hotel_budget_limit:
    feasibility_score -= 0.2

# Budget compliance (20% weight)
if total_cost > total_budget:
    feasibility_score -= 0.2

# Constraint satisfaction (10% weight)
# Additional constraints like travel time, preferences, etc.
```

### Feasibility Thresholds
- **0.8-1.0**: Excellent feasibility
- **0.6-0.8**: Good feasibility
- **0.4-0.6**: Moderate feasibility (may need adjustments)
- **0.0-0.4**: Poor feasibility (alternatives recommended)

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### API Failures
- **Flight API Down**: Uses mock data with feasibility warnings
- **Hotel API Down**: Uses estimated costs with availability warnings
- **Network Issues**: Provides offline feasibility estimates

### Data Quality Issues
- **Invalid Dates**: Uses default date ranges
- **Invalid Budgets**: Uses default budget allocations
- **Invalid Destinations**: Suggests nearby alternatives

### Graceful Degradation
- **Partial Feasibility**: Shows available information with warnings
- **No Alternatives**: Returns original recommendations with feasibility analysis
- **Complete Failure**: Falls back to standard destination research

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Individual feasibility checker methods
- **Integration Tests**: Full feasibility workflow
- **Edge Cases**: Invalid inputs, API failures, extreme constraints
- **Performance Tests**: Multiple destination checking

### Test Scenarios
1. **Budget Constraints**: Low budget scenarios
2. **Flight Availability**: Remote destinations
3. **Hotel Availability**: Peak season scenarios
4. **Traveler Types**: Different traveler requirements
5. **Seasonal Variations**: Different travel seasons
6. **API Failures**: Network and service issues
